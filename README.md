This is the custom UI Library built in NextJS and TailwindCSS
The documentation of this UI Library is supported by Storybook

## Getting Started

Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
#or
yarn add
#or
pnpm i #recommended
```

Run the storybook server:

```bash
npm storybook
# or
yarn storybook

```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.

You can start adding components by writing .tsx files in the `src/components/` directory.

To enable storybook support for the newly written components, you will have to add a respective `.stories.tsx` file for your component.

A simple example for a button has been done. Use that as a reference to add more components to the library!
